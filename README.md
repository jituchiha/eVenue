# eVenue

eVenue allows customers to search and book events and venues that they desire. Venue owners
can use the system to add venues and their availability. There is a login feature to access
reservation options or registration of events.
In case the user forgets their password, it is possible to retrieve it with the Forgot Password
feature. Users can add reserved events to their calendar and update their profiles to find events
that match their interests. There is also the option to customize the view of the system with
themes that change the color schema of the pages.
The system uses React JS for the front-end view features, MongoDB for the database, and
Python Flask for the back-end integration. MongoDB creates a non-relational database that is
organized in document sheets. React JS creates reactive webpages with easy integration and
implementation. Flask, through Python, creates a controller for the connection between frontend
requests and the database of our system
